      <h4 style="text-align:center">Casey Luong (born November 4, 1994),known mononymously by his stage name Keshi (stylized in all lowercase), is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, and multi-instrumentalist. Known for his distant falsetto vocals and textural instrumentals, he has accumulated over one billion streams with songs such as "Like I Need U", "2 Soon" and "Right Here".</h4>
      
	<p class="w3-large" style="text-align:center">He created the moniker "Keshi" and began to share music via his SoundCloud page around 2017. He credited watching YouTube tutorials for teaching him how to write, produce, and engineer his music.Initially, he was in doubt of his abilities and musical direction, but slowly his distinct style, which relies on his dreamy vocals combined with lo-fi beats and guitar, garnered more attention and popularity.In 2019, he quit his job as a nurse and flew to New York City to sign with Island Records. His decision to quit nursing and the pursuit of music was ultimately made due to his realization that the fear of missed opportunities exceeded his fear of failure.From there, his first singles attracted millions of listeners upon release.</p><br>
